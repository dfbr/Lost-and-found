# Project Idea: Lost and Found

## Overview
A platform and mobile app designed to connect people who have lost or found items. Users can post details such as pictures, locations, and descriptions for any lost or found articles. The platform facilitates communication between users via messaging to help reunite individuals with their belongings.

## Main Features
- **Post Creation:** Allow users to create detailed posts about lost or found items.
- **Image and Location Sharing:** Upload pictures and tag the location where the item was lost or found.
- **Item Matching:** Implement smart matching to identify similar posts based on keywords, locations, and uploaded images.
- **Notifications:** Notify users when a possible match is posted.
- **Messaging:** A secure way to communicate between users about items.
- **Search Filters:** Filter items by category, location, or time.

## Competitors
1. General social platforms such as Facebook Groups, Craigslist, and Nextdoor.
2. Specialized apps like LostMyThing, ImLost, and Found, which focus on lost and founds at a smaller scale.
3. Institution-specific systems (e.g., airports, universities) that only handle geographically limited items.

## Potential Differentiators
- Advanced search and matching algorithms for greater accuracy.
- Community-driven with gamification or rewards for helpful users.
- Scalability for both local and global applications, unlike geographically constrained competitors.
- Easy API/embedding for institutions to use within their existing systems.
